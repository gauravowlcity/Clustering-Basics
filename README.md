# Clustering US Senators based on how they voted
In this project, we'll work on clustering US Senators based on how they voted. We will try to find out whether the senators voted along party line or choose to be unaffiliated with a party?
We will apply clustering technique to find the patterns in the data.
Clustering algorithms group similar rows together.
There can be one or more groups in the data, and these groups form the clusters.
As we look at the clusters, we can start to better understand the structure of the data.
Clustering is a key way to explore unknown data, and it's a very commonly used machine learning technique.
